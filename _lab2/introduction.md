In this lab you will begin using complex signals and create an SSB demodulator. As you work through it, keep the following questions in mind:

- How is an SSB signal demodulated into an audio signal?
- What methods are used to tune to a desired signal?

You will then use the Universal Software Radio Peripherial (USRP) for both receiving and transmitting signals. The USRP is a I/Q receiver with wide bandwidth (100 MHz sampling rate), programmable center frequency, programmable gain and choice of sample rates.

## Deliverables

- 2 GRC files:
  - a resampling SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method
  - a direct sampling SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method
- A single page with answers to the questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are several questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

>There are also a number of questions included within the text which are not denoted "deliverable". Written answers to these questions are not required, but an effort should be made to think about and answer these questions as they are encountered

<!-- 1. SSB flowgraphs
    - GRC file of SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method.
    - block diagram of SSB receiver showing mathematical representation of signals at all points
   -->
<!-- 2. FM flowgraphs
    - GRC files of FM transmitter and receiver showing FM transmitted waveforms, spectra and FM receiver output.

1. USRP with FM
    - Observations on practical FM receiver operation using live off-air signals
    - bit rate of FSK signal at 142.17 MHz
    - Estimate of URSP receiver dynamic range with FM signals -->

<!-- 4. USRP with general IQ signals
    - Estimate of the USRP receiver noise figure.
    - IQ receiver measured frequency offset
    - Observations of I and Q at different signal levels and effect of dynamic range
    - USRP spectrum, minimum and maximum output power

>As usual, there are a number of questions included within the text. Written answers to these questions are not required, but an effort should be made to think about and answer these questions as they are encountered. -->
