In this lab you used a USRP and receive complex data streams. You both modulated and demodulated FM signals.

**Please unplug your USRP's power cable before leaving the lab.**

## Deliverables
<!-- #TODO update -->
- 2 GRC files:
  - an FM transmitter (`FM_transmitter.grc`)
  - an FM receiver (`FM_receiver.grc`)
- A single page with answers to the questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are 3 questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

If you are unsure how to submit the deliverables, ask your TA.
